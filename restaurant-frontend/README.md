# Pipedreams frontend test

This repo shows the solution for the frontend part described by [Pipedreams](https://www.pipedreams.com/)

## Getting Started

For this solution I decided to install some libraries to do the development faster, however some libraries are not compatible with last version of React and it has been updating, specially the [Attlassin Design System](https://atlassian.design/). 

For fetch data from the backend side I'm using axios library.

I create a custom stateless component that allows do a transitions between the days. You can check `src/components/Transition`


### Installing

For installing this project, you will need to force the intallation for last mention above. 

```
npm i -f
```

## Built With

- [React](https://react.dev/) - Library for the web intarfaces
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Routing the pages cooks and waiters
- [Styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) - Component-friendly CSS support for JSX
